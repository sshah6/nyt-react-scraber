## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. I will assume that you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed locally. 

1. Install dependencies
2. In your CLI, enter **mongod**
4. In a third CLI window, go to root and enter **yarn start**. This will start the webpack dev server.

Your browser should automatically open a new tab containing the app.

### Dependencies

You will need to yarn install the following node modules:

1. express
2. mongoose
3. body-parser
4. bluebird
5. axios
6. react
7. react-dom
8. react-router-dom
9. react-scripts
